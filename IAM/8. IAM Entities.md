This is an excellent final question, as it helps tie everything together. In AWS IAM, there are three primary **entities** (also called identities) that you manage to control who has access to your resources.

1. **IAM Users:** These are identities that represent a single person or a long-term application. A user has its own set of credentials (password for the console, and access keys for programmatic access). This is how a developer or an administrator would log in to the AWS console or use the AWS CLI.
    ####   Properties - 
	    1.UserNme
		2. password
		3. Access Key Id and Secret Access Key 
			1. a pair of credentials used for programmatic access services  through SDK or CLI which must be secret.
		4. Permission
		5. Multi Factor Authentication(MFA)


2. **[[IAM Groups]]:** A group is a collection of IAM users. It's not a person or an application itself, but a way to manage permissions more easily. Instead of attaching a policy to each user individually, you attach it to a group, and all users in that group inherit the permissions. This simplifies management, especially for large teams.
    
3. **[[9. IAM Roles]]:** A role is an identity that you can create and attach permissions to, but it's not permanently associated with a single person or application. Instead, it's something that can be **assumed** temporarily by an entity. This is the recommended way to grant permissions to:
    
    - **AWS services:** For example, you can assign a role to an EC2 instance so that it can securely access an S3 bucket without having to store credentials on the instance.
        
    - **Users in another AWS account:** You can create a role that trusts an external account, allowing a user from that account to temporarily assume the role and access your resources.
        
    - **Federated users:** Users who are authenticated outside of IAM (e.g., through your corporate directory) can assume a role to gain access to your AWS resources.
        

In addition to these three, it's also important to remember the **Root User**, which is the single, all-powerful identity that is created when you first open your AWS account. While it's a type of user, it is not an IAM entity and has special, unrestricted permissions. AWS strongly recommends not using it for daily tasks.

So, the core entities you work with every day in AWS IAM are **Users, Groups, and Roles**.
