An **inline policy** is a policy that you embed directly into a single IAM user, group, or role. It's not a standalone entity and exists only as long as the identity it's attached to. Think of it as a policy that is permanently and exclusively tied to one specific IAM entity.

It creates when you are creating new IAM user.

### Characteristics

- **One-to-One Relationship**: An inline policy can be attached to only **one** IAM user, group, or role at a time. This creates a tight, dedicated link between the policy and its principal.
    
- **No Reusability**: Unlike customer-managed policies, you cannot attach a single inline policy to multiple IAM identities. If you need the same permissions for another user, you must create a new, separate inline policy for them.
    
- **Deletion**: If you delete the IAM identity (user, group, or role) that an inline policy is attached to, the inline policy is also **automatically deleted**.
    
- **No Versioning**: Inline policies are not versioned like managed policies. When you update an inline policy, the changes take effect immediately without a version history.

### When to Use an Inline Policy

Inline policies are best used for a very specific, unique set of permissions that you do not intend to reuse. They are ideal for situations where the permissions are so tailored to a particular identity that they would not be relevant to any other identity in your AWS account.

For example, if you have a special `admin_user` who needs a unique permission to access a single, private S3 bucket and this permission will never be needed by anyone else, an inline policy might be a good fit.
