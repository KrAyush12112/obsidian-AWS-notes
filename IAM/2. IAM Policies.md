There are two main types of IAM policies: **managed policies** and **inline policies**. However, managed policies are further broken down into two subcategories.
Here's a breakdown of the different types of IAM policies in AWS:
### 1. Managed Policies

Managed policies are standalone IAM policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, or roles. They are reusable and versioned. There are two kinds:

- **[[3. AWS Managed Policies]]**: These are predefined policies created and maintained by AWS. They provide permissions for common use cases, like `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`. You can't edit them.
    
- **[[5. Customer Managed Policies]]**: These are policies you create and manage yourself. They allow for granular control and are perfect for implementing the principle of least privilege, as you can tailor them to your exact needs. They are reusable across your AWS account.
### 2. Inline Policies

An inline policy is a policy you embed directly into a single IAM user, group, or role. It's not a standalone entity and exists only as long as the identity it's attached to.

- **One-to-One Relationship**: Inline policies are specifically for a single IAM identity. If you delete the identity, the inline policy is also deleted.
    
- **Use Case**: They are often used when you need a very specific, unique set of permissions for a particular user or role that you don't intend to reuse.
  This is a single key that you tie to a specific person's belt loop. If that person leaves the office, you have to cut the string, and the key is gone forever.
	- **Dedicated Key:** This key can't be reused by anyone else. It's tied to just one person.
	- **Use Case:** You would use this for a very unique, one-off job that no one else will ever do.
### Summary Table

|Policy Type|Created By|Reusability|Versioning|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**AWS Managed**|AWS|High (many identities)|Yes, by AWS|Common, general-purpose access|
|**Customer Managed**|You|High (many identities)|Yes, by you|Custom, specific access for reusability|
|**Inline**|You|None (one identity only)|No|Unique, non-reusable permissions|
### Summary

- **Managed Policies (Reusable Key Rings):**
    
    - **AWS Managed:** Pre-made key rings from the building owner. Easy and fast to use, but sometimes give you more keys than you need.
        
    - **Customer Managed:** Key rings you create yourself. More secure because you can be very specific, but it takes more work to make them.
        
- **Inline Policies (Single, Non-Reusable Keys):**
    
    - A key that's permanently attached to one person. Useful for unique jobs, but not reusable.
