AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a core service in AWS that helps you **securely control access to AWS services and resources**.
IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions. 
It ensures that only authenticated (signed-in) and authorized entities can access your resources. 
By using IAM, you can follow the **principle of least privilege**, which means you grant only the permissions needed to perform a specific task, reducing the risk of security breaches.

## Key Components

- **IAM Users**: These are individual accounts for people or applications that need to interact with AWS. Each user has unique credentials (passwords or access keys).
    
- **IAM Groups**: A collection of users with similar access needs. Instead of attaching permissions to each user, you can assign permissions to a group. All users in that group automatically inherit those permissions.
    
- **IAM Roles**: These are identities with specific permissions that can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services. Roles are great for granting temporary access and are often used for things like giving an EC2 instance permission to access an S3 bucket.
    
- **[[2. IAM Policies]]**: JSON documents that define permissions. They specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources. Policies are attached to users, groups, or roles.

## How IAM Works

When a user or service makes a request to an AWS resource, IAM evaluates the request based on the following:

1. **Authentication**: IAM first verifies the identity of the user or service.
    
2. **Authorization**: IAM then checks the policies attached to that identity to see if they are authorized to perform the requested action on the specific resource.

This process ensures that every single request to an AWS resource is checked against a set of rules you define.

## Benefits and Best Practices

- **Enhanced Security**: By implementing the principle of least privilege, you can significantly reduce your security risk.
    
- **Centralized Control**: IAM provides a central location to manage access for your entire AWS account.
    
- **Compliance**: IAM helps you meet compliance requirements by allowing you to define, enforce, and audit permissions.
    
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Always enable MFA for your users, especially for the root account, to add an extra layer of security.
    
- **Never use the Root User for daily tasks**: The root user has unrestricted access. Create an IAM user with administrative privileges for everyday use and secure the root account.
    
- **Use roles for AWS services**: Don't use long-term access keys for applications running on EC2 or other services. Use IAM roles instead to grant temporary credentials.
