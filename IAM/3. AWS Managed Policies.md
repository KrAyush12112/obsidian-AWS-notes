**AWS managed policies** are policies created and updated by AWS for common IAM use cases. Here's a breakdown:

- **Owned by AWS**: They are written, maintained, and updated by AWS. You cannot edit their content directly.
    
- **Reusable**: A single AWS managed policy can be attached to multiple IAM users, groups, and roles.
    
- **Versioned**: When AWS updates a policy, it creates a new version without altering the existing attached policies, giving you control over when to adopt the new version.
    
- **Convenience**: They provide a quick way to grant permissions for a variety of common scenarios, like `AmazonS3FullAccess` or `ReadOnlyAccess`.
    
- **Less Granular**: *They are designed for general use, so they may grant broader permissions than what's needed for the principle of least privilege.* example EC2 require VPC permission
    
- **Best for**: Quickly assigning permissions without having to write complex JSON policy documents from scratch. They are a great starting point, especially for new AWS users.
# Types of AWS managed policies:
- **AWS Managed Policies for Job Functions:** These policies are designed to grant permissions for common job roles within an organization. They are often a great starting point for human users who need access to multiple services. Examples include:
    
    - `AdministratorAccess`
        
    - `PowerUserAccess`
        
    - `SecurityAudit`
        
    - `ReadOnlyAccess`
        
- **AWS Managed Policies for Specific Services:** These policies grant permissions for a specific AWS service. They are often used to define permissions for applications or services that need to interact with other AWS services. Examples include:
    
    - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
        
    - `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`
        
    - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
        
- **Service-Linked Policies:** These are a special type of AWS managed policy that is directly linked to an AWS service. When a service needs to perform actions on your behalf (e.g., launching an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling Group or managing a Kinesis stream), it often uses a service-linked role that has a service-linked policy attached to it.
    
    - **Uniqueness**: They are unique because they are predefined by the service itself and can't be attached to any other IAM entity.
        
    - **Automation**: They are created and managed by the AWS service automatically when you use a feature that requires it, which simplifies the setup process. For example, when you enable Amazon RDS, it automatically creates a service-linked role with the necessary permissions.
- The **"Service-linked policy"** you asked about is a special type of **AWS Managed Policy** that's created automatically. It's like the "Elevator Repairman" key ring that automatically appears when the elevator breaks down and an elevator company needs to come in and fix it. You don't have to create it; it just appears when a service needs it
- This is what happens when you use an AWS service that needs to do things in your account on its own. For example, when an Auto Scaling Group automatically launches new EC2 instances, it uses a service-linked role with a service-linked policy to perform that action on your behalf. You don't have to create this; AWS takes care of it automatically.

# LIMITATION 

The main limitation is that AWS managed policies are often **too permissive**.

The Problem with AWS-Managed "Key Rings"

Imagine the "SERVICE" (like `AmazonS3FullAccess`) gives a person access to every single storage closet (S3 bucket) in the entire building.

- **Convenience:** It's super fast to give someone the key ring so they can get started.
    
- **Security Risk:** What if that person only needs access to one specific storage closet, but the key ring gives them access to all of them, including the one with top-secret documents? This is a huge security risk.
    

This is the main limitation of AWS managed policies: they grant permissions on a service level, not a resource level. They often use a wildcard (`*`) for resources, which means "all resources of this type."
