These are policies you create and manage yourself. They allow for granular control and are perfect for implementing the principle of least privilege, as you can tailor them to your exact needs. They are reusable across your AWS account.

A **customer-managed policy** is a policy that **you create and control entirely**.
## Features: 
1. Created and managed by uuser.
2. Tailored for specific use
3. Attachable to mutiple IAM entities.
4. Manual update required.
5.  enable fine grade permission.
6. Versioning and rollback.
### Here’s a breakdown of what that means in simple terms:

- **You Are the Author**: Unlike AWS managed policies, which are read-only, you write the entire JSON document for a customer-managed policy. This gives you complete control over what permissions are granted.
    
- **Highly Specific**: You can grant permissions at a granular level. Instead of giving someone `AmazonS3FullAccess` (full access to every S3 bucket), you can write a policy that says, "Allow this user to put objects into only this one specific S3 bucket." This is the core of the **principle of least privilege**.
    
- **Reusable and Versioned**: Like AWS managed policies, a customer-managed policy is a standalone entity. You can create it once and attach it to multiple IAM users, groups, or roles. It also has its own version history, so you can easily revert to an older version if a change causes a problem.
    
- **Centralized Management**: Because they are standalone, it's easier to manage them. If you need to change a permission, you just edit the one policy, and the change is automatically applied to every identity it's attached to.

### Key Takeaway

The main reason to use a customer-managed policy is for **security and control**. By creating your own, you ensure that no user or service has more permissions than they absolutely require to do their job, which is a fundamental security best practice in the cloud.

1. JSON
2. VISUAL
