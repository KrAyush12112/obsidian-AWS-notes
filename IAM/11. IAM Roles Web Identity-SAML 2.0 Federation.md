It is a feature that enable secure acess to your aws resource using temporary credential obtained through and External IDP([[12 External identity provider]]) which may be google,facebook etc.

By using federation, you can grant temporary access to AWS resources without having to create and manage an IAM user for every person or application.
## Web Identity Federation

- Web Identity Federation is designed for authenticating users of public-facing applications (web and mobile) with an identity provider they already use

- It leverages(Use) open standards (Protocol) like **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and **OAuth 2.0**.
### 🔐 OAuth 2.0
- **Purpose**: Authorization
- **What it does**: Lets apps access your data (like email or photos) without needing your password.
- **Example**: You log into a new app using Google. The app gets permission to see your name and email, but not your password.
### 🆔 OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Purpose**: Authentication + Authorization
- **What it does**: Confirms who you are (your identity) and can also give access to your data.
- **Example**: You log into a website using Google. OIDC tells the site, “This is really you,” and shares your basic profile info.

**How it Works**:
> 	- An end-user signs in to your application using a public IdP like **Google, Facebook, or Login with Amazon**
> 	- The IdP(Google, Facebook) authenticates the user and provides a JSON Web Token (JWT)
> 	- Your application then uses this token (JWT) to call the AWS Security Token Service (STS) and assume a pre-configured IAM role.
> 	- AWS STS validates the token and, if valid, returns temporary security credentials that the application can use to access AWS resources on the user's behalf.

## **Use Cases**:

- This is the ideal solution for consumer-facing mobile and web applications, as it allows users to log in with an identity they already trust.
- You don't need to manage user credentials or passwords, and users can access your application and its AWS resources seamlessly.

# SAML 2.0 Federation - Security assertion markup language
SAML 2.0 Federation is the standard for connecting a company's corporate identity system to AWS.
It's used for **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, allowing employees to access the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI using their existing corporate credentials.

- **SAML** = Standard used for enterprise SSO (Single Sign-On).
- Corporate users log in via their identity provider (like Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, Ping Identity).
- IdP (identity provider) sends a **SAML assertion** to AWS.
- AWS STS API → **AssumeRoleWithSAML** validates it.
- Temporary AWS credentials are issued.

✅ Use case:

- Enterprise users using their **corporate credentials** (no AWS IAM users).
- Example: Your company’s SSO login → redirected to AWS console with role-based access.
## 🏢 Large Organization Setup (Active Directory + SAML)

1. **Active Directory (AD)**
    
    - Stores all employees’ usernames/passwords.
    - It’s the **central identity provider (IdP)**.
    - The same login is used for office Wi-Fi, internal apps, VPN, etc.
    
2. **SAML 2.0 Federation**
    
    - ActiveDirectory (or AD Federation Services / ADFS) issues **SAML assertions**.
    - These are like “proof-of-login” tokens.
    - Any service (called a **Service Provider**, e.g., AWS, Salesforce, Office 365) can trust these assertions if configured.
        
3. **AWS Integration**
    
    - AWS doesn’t need a separate IAM user for each employee.
    - Instead, you create **IAM roles** that trust the corporate IdP(identity provider) via SAML.
    - When an employee logs into the AWS Console → they’re redirected to the corporate login (SSO).
    - AD authenticates them, sends a SAML assertion to AWS.
    - AWS STS → `AssumeRoleWithSAML` → issues **temporary credentials** bound to that IAM role.

AWS Also provides its own AWS identity center to manage single sign on feature which use SAML 2.0 assertion to connect with external, other Identity provider
