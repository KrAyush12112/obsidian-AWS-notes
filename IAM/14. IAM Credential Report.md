# 📊 1. IAM Credential Report

- **What it is:** A CSV file listing **all IAM users** in the account + their security status.

    - User name
        
    - ARN, Creation time
        
    - Password enabled / last used
        
    - MFA enabled or not
        
    - Access keys (active, last rotated, last used)
        
    - Certificates
        
- **How you get it:** Console → IAM → “Credential report” → Download CSV.
    
- **Use case:** **Auditing security posture** (who has stale keys, who doesn’t have MFA, who never logged in).

# 📜 2. IAM Access Advisor Report

- **What it is:** Shows **service last accessed** data for IAM users, groups, and roles.
    
- **Includes:**
    
    - Which AWS services a user/role was allowed to use 
        
    - When each service was last accessed
        
- **How you get it:**
    
    - IAM Console → User/Role → “Access Advisor” tab.
        
    - Or `generate-service-last-accessed-details` via CLI.
        
- **Use case:** **Right-sizing permissions** (remove access to services never used). Helps move toward least privilege.

# 🛡️ 3. IAM Policy Report (a.k.a. Policy Access Analyzer)

- **How you get it:**
    
    - IAM → Access Analyzer → Create analyzer → View findings
        
    - CLI: `access-analyzer`

## ⚖️ Side-by-Side Difference

| Report Type                         | Scope                        | Main Purpose                          | Output Format |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Credential Report**               | IAM **users** only           | Audit credentials & MFA status        | CSV           |
| **Access Advisor**                  | IAM **users, roles, groups** | Show last-used services for pruning   | Console/CLI   |
| **Policy Report / Access analyzer** | IAM **policies & resources** | Analyze permissions & external access | Console/CLI   |

👉 Quick Memory Trick:

- **Credential report** = _Who they are + what creds they have_.
    
- **Access Advisor** = _What they actually used_.
    
- **Policy Report/Analyzer** = _What they could do_.
