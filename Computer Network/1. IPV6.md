## 🧠 What is a "Host" in Networking?

A **host** is **any device** that:

- Connects to a network
    
- Has an **IP address**
    
- Can **send or receive data**
    

### ✅ Examples of Hosts:

- Your **laptop** connected to Wi-Fi
    
- An **EC2 instance** in AWS
    
- A **smartphone** using mobile data
    
- A **printer** connected to your office network
    
- A **router**, **web server**, **IoT device**, etc.
    

If it’s on the network and has an IP address → it’s a **host**.

## 📦 In Context of IP Addressing

When we talk about **IPv4 or IPv6 subnets**, we divide the address into two parts:

`<network bits> + <host bits>`

- The **network part** identifies the **subnet** (or block)
    
- The **host part** identifies the **specific device** (host) in that subnet
    

---

### 🔍 Example — IPv4

Say you have: `192.168.1.0/24`

- `/24` means: first 24 bits = **network**
    
- Remaining 8 bits = **host**
    
- 2⁸ = **256 possible host addresses**
    
- So, you can have **254 usable hosts** (2 are reserved: 1 for network address, 1 for broadcast)
    

---

### 🔍 Example — IPv6

Say you have: `2600:abcd::/64`

- `/64` means: first 64 bits = **network**
    
- Last 64 bits = **host**
    
- 2⁶⁴ = **18,446,744,073,709,551,616 hosts**
    

This means: you can assign a **unique IPv6 address to that many devices** in the subnet. (Of course, in practice you won’t reach that number — it just shows how scalable IPv6 is.)

---

## 📌 Summary

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Host**|A device connected to a network with an IP address|
|**Host Part of IP**|The portion of the IP used to identify that specific device|
|**Host in Subnet**|One of the devices inside a subnet range (e.g., EC2 instance, laptop, etc.)|

---

So, when we say:

> “Each /64 subnet gives you 2^64 host addresses”

We mean:

> You can assign up to 2^64 **devices (hosts)** their own **unique IP addresses** inside that subnet.




Let’s break this down step-by-step so you understand **why a `/56` gives 256 `/64` subnets**, and why **each `/64` has 2^64 addresses** — without skipping anything.

---

### 🔢 Step 1: IPv6 Address Length Basics

- IPv6 addresses are **128 bits** long.
    
- CIDR notation like `/56` or `/64` tells you **how many bits are fixed (network part)**, and how many are **available (host part)**.
    

So:

- `/56` means **first 56 bits are fixed** — used for identifying the **VPC network**.
    
- Remaining bits (128 - 56 = 72 bits) are available to define subnets + hosts.
    

---

### 📦 Step 2: From /56 to /64 — Subnetting Logic

We now want to **create smaller subnet blocks** inside this /56.

- If you move from `/56` to `/64`, that means:
    
    - First 56 bits are fixed (VPC range)
        
    - Next 8 bits are used for subnetting
        
    - Last 64 bits are for host addresses in that subnet
        

How many combinations are possible with 8 bits?

- 2⁸ = **256**
    
- So: from a single `/56` block, you can create **256 unique /64 subnets**
    

#### 🧠 Example:

If AWS gives you:

`VPC IPv6 CIDR: 2600:1f14:abcd:1234::/56`

You can split it like:

- `2600:1f14:abcd:1234:0000::/64` → Subnet 0
    
- `2600:1f14:abcd:1234:0001::/64` → Subnet 1
    
- …
    
- `2600:1f14:abcd:1234:00ff::/64` → Subnet 255
    

So, **total 256 subnets**, each having `/64` range.

---

### 🏠 Step 3: What’s Inside a /64?

Now, let’s understand how many addresses exist **inside each `/64`**.

- In a `/64`, **64 bits are used for host addresses**.
    
- That means: **2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616** addresses per subnet.  
    (That’s over 18 quintillion!)
    

Each EC2 instance, load balancer, or any resource in that subnet gets a **globally routable unique address** from this pool.

---

### ⚖️ Summary Table

|CIDR|Network Bits|Host Bits|How Many Subnets/Hosts|
|---|---|---|---|
|`/56`|56|72|Gives 256 `/64` subnets (2⁸)|
|`/64`|64|64|Gives 2^64 hosts (per subnet)|

---

### 🤔 Why Use `/64` for Subnets?

In AWS (and most of the IPv6 world), it’s **best practice to use `/64` for subnets** because:

- It’s required for some IPv6 features (like SLAAC — Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)
    
- Devices and OS expect a `/64` to correctly generate their IPv6 addresses
    
- Anything smaller than `/64` (like `/65`) may cause unexpected behavior
    

---

### 📌 Real-World Implication in AWS

Let’s say:

- AWS gives you: `2600:1f14:abcd:1234::/56`
    
- You create a private subnet with: `2600:1f14:abcd:1234:00a1::/64`
    
- You enable auto-assign IPv6 on EC2
    

Then your EC2 gets an address like:

`2600:1f14:abcd:1234:00a1:abcd:ef12:3456`

`2600:1f14:abcd:1234  - fixed for vpc identification
`00a1 - Subnet address (upto 256)`
`abcd:ef12:3456 - host(any device, instance) address`

This address is:

- Publicly routable (no NAT needed)
    
- Unique globally
    
- Assigned from the `/64` subnet you made
    

---

### ✅ Conclusion

- A `/56` block means **you can carve out 256 separate subnets** using `/64` blocks.
    
- Each `/64` subnet can hold over **18 quintillion addresses**.
    
- That’s how IPv6 scales: **enormous subnet sizes, with no need for NAT**, and every device gets its own unique address.
