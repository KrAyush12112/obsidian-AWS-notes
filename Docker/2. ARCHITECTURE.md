- Docker uses a **client-server architecture**. 
- **This means the tool you type into (Client) is separate from the tool that actually does the work (Server/Daemon).**
- The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
-  The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface
#  1. Docker Client (`docker`)
- **What it is:** This is the Command Line Interface (CLI) you use in your terminal (e.g., when you type `docker build` or `docker run`).
    
- **How it works:** It does **not** do the heavy lifting. It takes your command and sends it (via an API) to the Docker Daemon to execute.

# 2. Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)
- **What it is:** A background process (server) that runs on the host machine.
    
- **How it works:** It listens for requests from the Docker Client. It is the "brain" that actually builds, runs, and distributes your containers. If the Daemon crashes, your Docker stops working.

# 3. Docker Registry
- **What it is:** A storage location for Docker Images.
- **Examples:**
    - **Docker Hub:** The default public registry (like GitHub for Docker images).
    - **AWS ECR:** A private registry on AWS.
- **How it works:** When you type `docker pull node`, the Daemon goes to the Registry to download the Node image.
# 4. Docker Objects
- **What it is:** "Object" is a generic term for the things Docker creates and manages.
- **The Main Objects:**
    
    - **IMAGES:** The blueprints (Read-only).
        
    - **CONTAINERS:** The running instances (Runnable).
        
    - **VOLUMES:** The data storage (Persist data).
        
    - **NETWORKS:** The communication channels (Connect containers).

> [!NOTE]
> WHY ON LINUX OVER WINDOWS
> - **On Ubuntu (EC2):** Docker runs **Natively**. The Docker Daemon talks directly to the Ubuntu Kernel. It is slightly faster and more efficient.
>     
> - **On Windows:** Docker runs **virtually**. Since Docker containers need a Linux Kernel (and Windows has a Windows Kernel), Docker Desktop installs a tiny, hidden Linux environment inside your Windows machine called **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
