### **The Declarative Way (Docker Compose)**

**Concept:** Instead of typing long commands (Imperative), you write a **configuration file** (Docker file otr YAML) that describes exactly what your application needs. You tell Docker _"This is the result I want,"_ and Docker figures out how to build and run it.

- You **write configuration** instead of typing commands.
- The configuration file defines:
    - Which image to use
    - What ports to expose
    - Volumes to mount
    - Environment variables
    - Restart policies
- Then you run a single command (`docker-compose up` or `kubectl apply`) to create the container(s).
### 3. **Example: Docker Compose (Declarative)**
The language name is - yaml
```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

👉 Explanation:

- `version: '3'` → Compose file format version.
- `services:` → Defines containers or List of containers to run.
- `web:` → Service name.
- `image: nginx:latest` → Which image to use.
- `ports:` → Maps host port 8080 to container port 80.
- `volumes:` → Mounts local `./html` folder into container’s web root.
Run it with:
bash
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. **Advantages of Declarative Method**

- **Repeatability** → Same file can be used on any machine.
- **Automation** → No need to remember long commands.
- **Scalability** → Easy to define multiple services (web, db, cache).
- **Version Control** → Config files can be stored in Git.
### 6. **Key Difference**

- **Imperative** → "Do this step now" (manual commands).
- **Declarative** → "Here’s the desired state, make it happen" (YAML/Compose files).

✅ **Summary:** Using the declarative method, you define container configuration in YAML files (Docker Compose or Kubernetes). This makes deployments reproducible, scalable, and easier to manage compared to typing commands manually.


> [!NOTE] There is huge diffrence between YAML And docker file
> Here is the difference:
> 1. **Dockerfile (What your instructor described):** This is the **Recipe**. It tells Docker **how to BUILD** the image. It uses commands like `FROM`, `RUN`, and `CMD`.
> 2. **YAML File (`docker-compose.yml`):** This is the **Manager**. It tells Docker **how to RUN** the container (which ports to open, which volumes to connect).

Let's break down exactly what your instructor told you, and match it to the correct file.
