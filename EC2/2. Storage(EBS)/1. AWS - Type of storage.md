## **1. Block Storage**
Low-latency, like a virtual hard drive directly attached to your instance.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** → Persistent storage for EC2, survives instance stop/start.
    - Types:
        - **gp3 / gp2** → General Purpose SSD
        - **io2 / io1** → Provisioned IOPS SSD (high performance, critical workloads)
        - **st1** → Throughput-optimized HDD (big data, logs)
        - **sc1** → Cold HDD (cheap, infrequent access)
- **Instance Store** → Temporary storage physically attached to the host (Real hardware ). Lost if you stop/terminate the instance.
---
## **2. Object Storage**
Stores data as objects (good for unstructured data, backups, media).
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** → Scalable, durable storage for any data.
    - Storage Classes:
        - **S3 Standard** → Frequent access
        - **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** → Automatic cost optimization
        - **S3 Standard-IA** → Infrequent Access
        - **S3 One Zone-IA** → Single AZ, cheaper
        - **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** → Archival, seconds retrieval
        - **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** → Hours retrieval
        - **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** → Cheapest, long-term archive
- **S3 on Outposts** → S3 but on your own hardware via AWS Outposts.

## **3. File Storage**

Shared storage accessible by multiple instances.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)** → Fully managed, scalable **[Network File System (NFS)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=EC2%2F2.%20Storage(EBS)%2F1.2%20NFS%20Protocol)** file system (Linux only).
    - Modes: Standard, Infrequent Access.
- **FSx** → Managed Windows or specialized file systems.
    - **FSx for Windows File Server** → SMB protocol
    - **FSx for Lustre** → High-performance file system for compute workloads
    - **FSx for OpenZFS** and **FSx for NetApp ONTAP** for enterprise use
---
## **4. Hybrid / Edge Storage**
Mix of on-premises + cloud storage.
- **AWS Storage Gateway** → Connects on-prem storage to AWS.
    - File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway.
- **Snow Family** (Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile) → Data transfer & edge compute.
---
## **5. Specialized / Database Storage**

- **DynamoDB DAX** → In-memory cache for DynamoDB.
- **RDS / Aurora Storage** → Managed block storage for databases.
- **Elasticache** (Redis/Memcached) → In-memory storage.
