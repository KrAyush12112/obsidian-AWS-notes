Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that uses "tickets" to verify the identity of a user or host. 
It allows nodes(Client) on an insecure network to prove their identity to one another without transmitting passwords in plaintext. 
Kerberos is widely used and is the default authentication protocol for Microsoft Windows since Windows 2000. 
Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically the three-headed dog, Cerberus, which guards the underworld. 
This is fitting, as the Kerberos protocol involves three main components: a client, a server, and a trusted third party known as the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**.

## How it works

The Kerberos protocol works in a series of steps to authenticate a user and **grant them access to a service**. The process is ticket-based, ensuring that the user's password is never transmitted across the network.

- **Initial Authentication**: When a user logs in, their client sends a request to the **Authentication Server (AS)**, which is part of the KDC. 
- The AS checks the user's credentials against its database. If they are valid, it issues a **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)**. The TGT is encrypted with a key known only to the KDC and is sent back to the user's client. The client, using a hash of the user's password, can decrypt a portion of the message to retrieve a session key for future communication with the KDC.
    
- **Requesting a Service Ticket**: To access a specific service (like a file server or web application), the client sends the TGT to the **Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)**, another part of the KDC. The TGS verifies the TGT, and if it's valid, it issues a **service ticket** for the requested resource. This service ticket is encrypted using a key shared between the TGS and the target server.
    
- **Accessing the Service**: The client then presents the service ticket to the target server. The server uses its secret key to decrypt the ticket and verify the user's identity. If successful, the user is granted access.
    

This multi-step process provides **mutual authentication**, where both the user and the server verify each other's identity, and enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, allowing a user to access multiple services without re-entering their credentials.

**Kerberos is used when you need:**

- **Strong Authentication** → server shouldn’t just “trust” an IP or UID; it should confirm identity properly.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** → login once, then access multiple services without re-entering password.
- **Centralized Control** → one trusted server (KDC) manages all authentication.
- **Encryption/Integrity** → protect data from sniffing and tampering.

👉 Without Kerberos → anyone who spoofs UID or packet can bypass security.  
👉 With Kerberos → every access is verified with cryptographic tickets.
