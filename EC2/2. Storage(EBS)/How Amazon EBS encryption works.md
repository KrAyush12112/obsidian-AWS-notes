### 🔐 What EBS Encryption Covers

When you create an encrypted EBS volume, the following are encrypted:

- **Data at rest** inside the volume
- **Data in transit** between the volume and the EC2 instance
- **Snapshots** created from the volume
- **Volumes** created from encrypted snapshots
### 🧠 How Encryption Is Managed

Amazon EBS uses **AES-256** encryption and integrates with **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:

- A **data key** is generated by AWS KMS.
    
- This data key is then encrypted using a **KMS key** (either AWS-managed or customer-managed).
    
- The encrypted data key is stored with the volume metadata.
    

You can use:

- **AWS-managed keys** (default, alias: `aws/ebs`)
    
- **Customer-managed keys** for more control (e.g., rotation, disabling)
### 🧰 How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You create an encrypted volume** AWS says, “Cool, let’s lock this up.” It grabs a secret key from a service called **KMS** (Key Management Service).
    
2. **That key is used to scramble your data** Everything you save—files, databases, whatever—is turned into unreadable gibberish using a super strong lock called **AES-256**.
    
3. **The key itself is locked too** AWS doesn’t just leave the key lying around. It wraps that key in another layer of protection using a master key.
    
4. **When you use the volume** AWS quietly unlocks the data behind the scenes using the key, so your EC2 instance can read/write like normal. You don’t even notice it happening.
### 📦 What Gets Encrypted?

- Your actual data on the volume
    
- Data moving between your EC2 and the volume
    
- Snapshots (backups) of the volume
    
- New volumes made from those snapshots
### 🧠 What If the Key Stops Working?

Let’s say you disable or delete the key:

- If the volume is **still attached**, it keeps working (because the key is in memory).
    
- If you **detach** it, AWS forgets the key.
    
- Next time you try to attach it, AWS says “Nope, can’t unlock this” unless you fix the key.
