## **1. Block Storage**

Low-latency, like a virtual hard drive directly attached to your instance.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** → Persistent storage for EC2, survives instance stop/start.
    - Types:
        - **gp3 / gp2** → General Purpose SSD
        - **io2 / io1** → Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations) SSD (high performance, critical workloads)
        - **st1** → Throughput-optimized HDD (big data, logs)
        - **sc1** → Cold HDD (cheap, infrequent access)
- **Instance Store** → Temporary storage physically attached to the host. Lost if you stop/terminate the instance.
- Life-time of ebs - EBS volumes are **independent from instance lifetime**, but there’s a catch.
### 3 Type of EBS States
### **1. Root EBS Volume (default behavior)**
- By default, **root volume** (the one your OS is on) has `"DeleteOnTermination" = true`.
- This means if you terminate the EC2, AWS will automatically delete that volume **unless** you uncheck that option during launch or modify it later.
---
### **2. Additional (Attached) EBS Volumes** 
- For any extra EBS volume you attach manually, the default `"DeleteOnTermination"` is **false**.
- These volumes **stay alive** even after the instance is terminated — you’ll still pay for them until you delete them.
---
### **3. Instance Store Volumes**
- These are **physically attached to the host** (ephemeral).
- Lost when you stop or terminate the instance, **no way to recover**.
---
✅ **Key point:**  
EBS lifetime ≠ instance lifetime.  
###### It only dies automatically if the "DeleteOnTermination" flag is set to true.

##### **EBS volume types**

## **1. gp3 (General Purpose SSD v3)**

- **Type:** SSD
- **Use case:** Balanced performance for most workloads (web apps, dev/test, small DBs).
- **Performance:**
    - Baseline: 3,000 IOPS
    - You can scale IOPS up to **16,000** and throughput up to **1,000 MB/s** independently of size.
- **Why it’s popular:** Cheaper than gp2, more predictable performance.

---
## **2. io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD v2)**

- **Type:** SSD
- **Use case:** High-performance, mission-critical workloads (large databases, OLTP, analytics).
- **Performance:**
    - Can provision up to **64,000 IOPS** (Nitro systems).
    - Durability: **99.999%** (higher than gp3).
- **Why use:** When you can’t risk latency spikes — e.g., production DBs where milliseconds matter.
- **Expensive** compared to gp3.

---

## **3. st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)**
- **Type:** HDD (magnetic)
- **Use case:** Large, sequential workloads (data warehouses, big data, log processing).
- **Performance:**
    - Focus on **MB/s throughput**, not IOPS.
    - Up to ~500 MB/s depending on size.
- **Cheap** but **not for small random reads/writes**.
---
## **4. sc1 (Cold HDD)**
- **Type:** HDD (magnetic)
- **Use case:** Infrequent access, archival, lowest-cost block storage.
- **Performance:**
    - Much lower throughput (~250 MB/s) and IOPS.
    - Good for data you barely touch but need online.
- **Cheapest** EBS option.
---

💡 **Quick memory tip:**
- **SSD = gp3, io2** (fast, low latency)
- **HDD = st1, sc1** (cheap, sequential storage)
- gp3 → general, io2 → premium speed, st1 → fast HDD, sc1 → slow HDD.

## **1. The Core Difference: How They Store & Access Data**

|Service|Storage Model|Access Pattern|Latency|Typical Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**EBS**|**Block Storage** (virtual hard drive)|Mount to a single EC2 instance (like `/dev/sda1`)|Low ms|OS disks, databases, application storage|
|**S3**|**Object Storage** (data + metadata + ID)|Access via HTTP(S) API (no “mount”)|Higher ms|Backups, images, static files, big data|
|**EFS**|**File Storage** (shared file system)|Mount to many EC2 instances (NFS)|Low ms|Shared web content, multiple app servers|
|**Instance Store**|Local Block Storage|Only for one instance, temporary|Microseconds|Caching, temporary processing|
|**Glacier** (S3 tier)|Object Storage (archive)|API access after restore delay|Minutes to hours|Cold archive, compliance data|


##### Throughput and Volume Initialization Rate

### ⚡ Throughput (Speed of Data Flow)

Think of **throughput** like the speed of a water pipe. It’s how fast data can flow between your EC2 instance and its attached storage (like EBS).

- Measured in **MB/s** (megabytes per second)
- Higher throughput = faster read/write speeds
- Important for apps that move big files or stream data (e.g., video processing, databases)

💡 Example: If your EBS volume has 250 MB/s throughput, it can transfer 250 megabytes of data every second.

### 🚀 Volume Initialization Rate (Speed of Warming Up)

This is about how fast an EBS volume becomes **fully ready** when created from a snapshot.

Normally, when you create a volume from a snapshot:

- AWS **lazy-loads** the data (only loads blocks when accessed)
    
- This causes slow performance at first
    

With **Provisioned Volume Initialization Rate**, you can say:

> “Yo AWS, preload this volume at 300 MB/s so it’s ready to go fast!”

- You set a rate (100–300 MB/s) for how quickly AWS copies snapshot data to the volume
    
- Your EC2 instance gets full performance **immediately**, not gradually
    

💡 Example: Launching 100 EC2s from a snapshot-based AMI? Set a 300 MB/s rate and all volumes will be warmed up fast2.

### 🔄 Quick Comparison

|Term|What It Means|Why It Matters|
|---|---|---|
|**Throughput**|Speed of reading/writing data|Affects app performance during use|
|**Initialization Rate**|Speed of preparing volume from snapshot|Affects how fast your app boots up|

##### File system and its component (EFS and FSx)
