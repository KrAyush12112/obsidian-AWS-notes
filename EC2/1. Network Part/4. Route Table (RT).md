## 🧭 What is a **Route Table** in AWS?

> A **Route Table** in AWS tells your VPC/subnet:  
> 👉 **Where to send network traffic.**

It’s like Google Maps for your network.  
Each route says:

- **What IP range** (destination)
    
- **Where to send it** (target: IGW, NAT, local, etc.)
## 📦 Route Table Example:

| Destination   | Target                          | Meaning                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | `local`                         | Internal traffic inside the VPC                 |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | `igw-xyz123` (Internet Gateway) | **All external traffic** (Internet) goes to IGW |
### 🔄 Who Uses It?

Every **Subnet** must be associated with a **Route Table**.  
The subnet follows the routing rules in that table.

## 🔎 What is `0.0.0.0/0`?

> `0.0.0.0/0` means "**all possible IPv4 addresses**".  
> It's a **wildcard** — it matches every IP address not already matched by a more specific rule.

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

- It says: “Any traffic **going outside the VPC**, send it to this target.”
