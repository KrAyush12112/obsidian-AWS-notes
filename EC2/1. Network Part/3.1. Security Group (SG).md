**Security Group (SG) – Basic Definition:**  
In AWS, a security group acts as a **virtual firewall** for your EC2 instances (or other supported resources) to control inbound and outbound traffic at the **instance level**. Unlike a traditional firewall appliance, it’s:

- **Stateful** → If inbound traffic is allowed, the outbound response is automatically allowed, and vice versa.
    
- **Attached to resources** (like EC2, ENIs, RDS), not subnets.
## **Important Terms in a Security Group Rule**

1. **Type**
    
    - A pre-defined template for a traffic rule (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).
        
    - When you pick a type, AWS auto-fills the corresponding **protocol** and **port range**.
        
    - Example: Type = “SSH” → Protocol = TCP, Port Range = 22.
        
2. **Protocol**
    
    - The network protocol used for communication.
        
    - Determines how data is transmitted (rules must match the protocol of the traffic you want to allow/deny).
        
    - Common ones:
        
        - **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) → Reliable, ordered connection (used by HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, RDP, etc.).
            
        - **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) → Faster, connectionless (used by DNS, VoIP, video streaming, etc.).
            
        - **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) → Used for network diagnostics (ping, traceroute).
            
        - **ALL** → All protocols allowed.
            
        - **Custom Protocol Number** → For less common protocols.
            
3. **Port Range**
    
    - The specific port(s) the rule applies to.
        
    - Examples:
        
        - 22 → SSH
            
        - 80 → HTTP
            
        - 443 → HTTPS
            
    - Can be:
        
        - **Single port** (e.g., 443)
            
        - **Range** (e.g., 1024–65535 for ephemeral ports)
            
        - **All ports** (0–65535)
