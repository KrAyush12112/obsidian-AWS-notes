##### **Story based explanation -**
I construct a new house (VPC).  
The house has multiple rooms (subnets).  
By default, the house( VPC) has **no doors or windows** (no internet access).  
I **choose to install a main door [[2. Internet Gateway (IGW)]])** and **connect it to only some rooms** (public subnets).  
For privacy, **important things go in rooms with no doors to outside** (private subnets).  
I also decide who can enter which room, using **keys and security (SGs, NACLs).**

| Locking some rooms with no outside door | Private Subnets                 |     |
| Rooms with windows to outside world     | Public Subnets                  |     |
| Assigning who can enter                 | Security rules / Inbound access |     |

### 🧩 2. [[3. Subnet]]
A subnet is a range of IP addresses of your VPC’s IP address range. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone. After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

You can create:

- **Public Subnets** → Allow internet access
    
- **Private Subnets** → No internet, for internal resources (like DB)
## 🌐 3. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

> A **bridge between your VPC and the internet**.

- Needed to allow **outbound/inbound internet traffic** (like SSH, HTTP)

- Must be:
    1. **Created**
        
    2. **Attached to your VPC**
        
    3. **Referenced in a Route Table**
    
🧠 If your EC2 doesn’t go through IGW, **no internet access**, even if it has a public IP.

## 🛡️ 4. **[[3.1. Security Group (SG)]]**

> Like a **firewall** attached to your EC2 instance.

- Controls **which ports and IPs** can talk to your EC2
    
- Inbound rules = who can enter (e.g. SSH from your IP)
    
- Outbound rules = where your EC2 can send data
    

🧠 No open port = no access. Even if your server is running.

### 🔥 Example:

Want to SSH into EC2 from your laptop?
	- You must have to allow Inbound traffic SSH into your ec2
- SG must have:

    `Inbound: 
    `Type: SSH (port 22)` 
    `Source: Your public IP (e.g. 103.x.x.x/32)`

## 📛 6. **NACL (Network ACL)**

> A **firewall at subnet level** (not instance level like SG).

- Stateless: If you allow traffic in, you must also allow it out.
    
- More granular but **harder to manage** than SGs
    
- Mostly used for **extra security or compliance**
    

## 🆔 7. **Elastic IP**

> A **fixed public IP** address that you can associate with any EC2.

- By default, when you stop/start EC2, public IP changes
    
- With Elastic IP, you can keep the same IP — great for servers

### Tenancy
This option defines if EC2 instances that you launch into the VPC will run on hardware that's shared with other AWS accounts or on hardware that's dedicated for your use only.


If you choose the tenancy of the VPC to be **Dedicated,** the instances will always run as Dedicated Instances on hardware that's dedicated for your use.

If you choose the tenancy of the VPC to be **Default**, EC2 instances launched into this VPC will use the tenancy attribute specified when you launch the instance
