# ⚡ WebSockets in ALB

### **1. What is WebSocket?**
- Normally, **HTTP is request-response**: client asks → server replies → connection closes.
- But some apps need **real-time, continuous communication** (e.g., chat apps, stock tickers, gaming, live dashboards).
- WebSocket is a protocol built on top of TCP that allows a **persistent, two-way connection** between client and server.

👉 Instead of reconnecting again and again, WebSocket keeps a **single long-lived connection open**.

---
### **2. How ALB Helps**

- ALB **fully supports WebSocket connections**.
- It can route WebSocket traffic just like normal HTTP, but keeps the connection open.
- If one backend server goes down, ALB can shift the WebSocket session to a healthy target (depending on stickiness settings).

**Real Example:**

- Chat app → browser connects via WebSocket → ALB → backend chat server.
- Updates (messages, typing indicators, online status) flow in real-time.

# ⚡ HTTP/2 in ALB

### **1. What is HTTP/2?**
- Newer version of HTTP, faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
- Features:
    - **Multiplexing** → multiple requests sent in one TCP connection.
    - **Header compression** → reduces overhead.
    - **Server push** → server can proactively send resources before client asks.
👉 This reduces latency, especially for web apps with lots of small requests (CSS, JS, images).

### **5. Example**

Suppose your website loads:
- 1 HTML file
- 10 images
- 5 JS files
- 3 CSS files
- With **HTTP/1.1** → each file = separate request = delays.
- With **HTTP/2** → all requests ride over **one connection in parallel** = faster load
### **6. Analogy**

- **HTTP/1.1** = Sending one **parcel per item** (shirt, pants, shoes all in separate boxes).
- **HTTP/2** = Packing **everything in one big box** and sending it together.
---
### **2. How ALB Helps**

- ALB **supports HTTP/2 for clients** automatically.
- But between **ALB → backend servers**, it still uses HTTP/1.1 (for simplicity and compatibility).
- This means your clients benefit from speed, while your backend doesn’t need to change anything.

**Real Example:**

- A web app with many assets (JS, CSS, images) → HTTP/2 reduces page load time.
- Browser ↔ ALB runs HTTP/2, but ALB ↔ EC2 stays HTTP/1.1.

# 🧠 Analogy

- **WebSocket** = A **phone call** (continuous, two-way).
- **HTTP/1.1** = Sending one **letter per message**.
- **HTTP/2** = Sending multiple **letters in one big envelope** → faster.
---

✅ Bottom line:
- **WebSockets** = For **real-time apps** (chat, gaming, live dashboards).
- **HTTP/2** = For **faster page loads & efficient web browsing**.
- ALB supports both **out of the box**, no special setup needed — just enable them on your ALB listener.
