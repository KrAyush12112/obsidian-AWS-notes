# 🔐 SSL/TLS Termination in ALB

### **1. What’s SSL/TLS?

- When you see `https://`, your browser and server communicate in **encrypted form** using SSL/TLS.
- This prevents snooping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
So every HTTPS request needs to be **encrypted at the client** and **decrypted at the server**.
### **2. The Problem Without a Load Balancer**

If you have 100 servers:
- Each server needs its own SSL/TLS certificate.
- Each server must do encryption/decryption work for every request → high CPU usage.
This is expensive and a pain to manage.

### **3. SSL/TLS Termination at the Load Balancer**

- Instead of every backend server handling HTTPS, the **ALB does the decryption once at the edge**.
- ALB holds the SSL/TLS certificate (via AWS ACM or uploaded manually).
- After decrypting, ALB forwards **plain HTTP traffic** to your backend servers.

👉 This is called **SSL Termination** because the secure connection “ends” at the ALB


**Two Options - (a)&(b)**
#### **(a) SSL Termination Only (most common)**
- Client → (HTTPS, encrypted) → ALB
- ALB → (HTTP, plain text) → Backend
✅ Pros:
- Servers don’t waste CPU on encryption.
- Only need to manage certs on ALB (not on every server).
❌ Cons:
- Traffic between ALB → backend is **not encrypted** (but usually safe if inside private VPC).
#### **b) End-to-End Encryption**
- Client → (HTTPS) → ALB
- ALB → (HTTPS again) → Backend
Here
- ALB decrypts traffic, then **re-encrypts** it before sending to backend.
- Backend also needs SSL certs.
✅ Pros:
- Full encryption, even inside your private network.  
❌ Cons:
- More CPU usage on servers.
- More certificate management.
