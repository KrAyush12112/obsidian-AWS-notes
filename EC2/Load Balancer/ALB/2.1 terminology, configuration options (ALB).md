Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Creating an Application Load Balancer involves configuring several key components, each with its own specific terminology. Here is a breakdown of the essential terms you'll encounter during the setup process:
### Load Balancer Fundamentals

- **Load Balancer Name:** A unique name for your load balancer within your AWS account and the specific region. It must be unique and can contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
    
- **Scheme:** Determines the accessibility of your load balancer.
    
    - **Internet-facing:** The load balancer has a public DNS name and public IP addresses, allowing it to route requests from the internet to your targets.
        
    - **Internal:** The load balancer has a private DNS name and private IP addresses, routing requests only to targets within your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
        
- **IP Address Type:** Specifies the type of IP addresses used by the load balancer.
    
    - **IPv4:** Supports only IPv4 addresses for communication.
        
    - **Dualstack:** Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, allowing clients to connect using either protocol.

### Network & Security Configuration

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** The isolated virtual network where your load balancer and its targets reside.
    
- **Subnets:** Subdivisions of a VPC. You must select at least two subnets in different Availability Zones for your load balancer to ensure high availability. The load balancer creates a node in each selected subnet.
    
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** An isolated location within an AWS Region. Using multiple AZs provides fault tolerance and redundancy.
    
- **Security Group:** A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for your load balancer. It acts as a security layer, defining which traffic is allowed to reach your load balancer and its targets.

### Routing and Target Management

- **Listener:** A process that checks for connection requests using a specific protocol and port from internal or internet. For an Application Load Balancer, a listener typically listens on HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).
    
- **Rules:** Defined for a listener, these rules determine how the load balancer routes requests. Rules consist of a **condition** (e.g., based on the URL path or host header) and an **action** (e.g., forward the request to a specific target group). The rules are evaluated in priority order.
    
- **Target Group:** A logical group of targets, such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions. The load balancer routes requests to the targets registered within a target group.
    
- **Health Checks:** A configuration within a target group that monitors the health of its registered targets. The load balancer will only route traffic to healthy targets. You can define the protocol, port, and criteria for what constitutes a healthy target.
    
- **Target:** The actual resource (like an EC2 instance, container, or IP address) that receives the traffic from the load balancer. You register these targets with a target group.
### 🔹 **Advanced Features**

- **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**
    - Distributes traffic evenly across all registered targets in all AZs.
- **Idle Timeout**
    - Time (default 60s) before closing inactive connections.
- **Access Logs**
    - Option to store logs in an S3 bucket for monitoring/analysis.
        
- **Deletion Protection**
    - Prevents accidental deletion of the ALB.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
    - Can be associated for additional protection (blocking SQLi, XSS, etc.).
- **Tags**
    - Key-value metadata for identification, billing, and automation.
