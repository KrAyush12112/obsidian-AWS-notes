**The Only Diffrence In NLB and ALB is-**
**Static IP addresses** on a Network Load Balancer (NLB) are fixed, public IP addresses that do not change over time. This is a key feature that distinguishes NLBs from Application Load Balancers (ALBs), which use dynamic IP addresses that can change.

### How It Works & Configuration

When you create an NLB, it automatically gets a static IP address for each **Availability Zone** (AZ) you enable. This IP address remains associated with the NLB for its entire life, as long as you don't remove the corresponding subnet from the configuration.

You can also opt to use an **Elastic IP address** (EIP) for each subnet. An EIP is a public IPv4 address you own and can re-assign. By associating an EIP with your NLB in each AZ, you get a fixed, publicly routable IP address that gives you more control and a consistent entry point for your application.

#### The main configuration options are:

- **AWS-assigned Static IPs:** By default, the NLB provides a static IP for each subnet you enable.4 You don't need to do anything to get this.
    
- **Elastic IPs:** When you're configuring the NLB, you can select an available Elastic IP address for each subnet.5 This is useful for when you need to maintain a fixed IP address for whitelisting purposes, such as in firewalls or for third-party integrations that require a static IP.6

### Why Static IPs Are Important

The static IP feature is a primary reason to choose an NLB. It is essential for applications that require a **predictable, unchangeable IP address**. Examples include:

- **Firewall Whitelisting:** Many corporate networks and third-party services require you to whitelist specific IP addresses to allow traffic.7 A static IP on your NLB simplifies this process, as you don't need to constantly update the firewall rules.8
    
- **External Dependencies:** Some legacy systems, APIs, or clients may be hard-coded to connect to a specific IP address. The static IP ensures these systems can always reach your load-balanced application.
    
- **PrivateLink Integration:** NLBs are often used as the front-end for AWS PrivateLink, which allows you to expose services to other VPCs using private, static IP addresses.
    

While an Application Load Balancer is great for most modern web applications, the lack of a static IP address makes it a poor choice when you need the stability and predictability of a fixed IP address.

## 🔹 Why ALB doesn’t have Static IPs?

- ALB ka traffic Layer 7 pe hota hai → AWS apne internal pool se IP rotate karta hai for scaling/security.
    
- Isliye ALB ke saath hamesha **DNS name** use karna padta hai.
