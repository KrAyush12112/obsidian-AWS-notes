Cross-zone load balancing is a feature of AWS Elastic Load Balancing that allows a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic **evenly across all registered targets** in all enabled Availability Zones (AZs).
 
Without cross-zone load balancing enabled, each load balancer node only distributes traffic to the targets within its own Availability Zone. This can lead to an uneven distribution of traffic if the number of targets in each AZ is not the same. For example, if you have one EC2 instance in AZ-A and five instances in AZ-B, the instance in AZ-A could get overloaded, while the instances in AZ-B are underutilized.

### How It Works

- **With Cross-Zone Load Balancing Disabled:** Each load balancer node routes traffic only to targets in its local AZ. This can result in an imbalance, where some targets receive a disproportionately higher load than others if the number of targets per AZ is not equal.
    
- **With Cross-Zone Load Balancing Enabled:** Each load balancer node can route traffic to **any healthy target** in any of the enabled Availability Zones. This ensures that the overall traffic is distributed evenly across all your targets, regardless of which AZ they are in. This significantly improves fault tolerance and resource utilization.
    

### Configuration and Cost

The default setting for cross-zone load balancing varies depending on the type of load balancer:

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Cross-zone load balancing is **always enabled** by default at the load balancer level and you cannot disable it.
    
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Cross-zone load balancing is **disabled by default**. You must explicitly enable it to achieve a more even distribution of traffic.
    

While the feature itself is free, there may be **data transfer costs** associated with it. For an NLB, you are charged for the data that is transferred between Availability Zones when cross-zone load balancing is enabled. However, for an ALB, you are not charged for this specific regional data transfer, as the feature is always on.
