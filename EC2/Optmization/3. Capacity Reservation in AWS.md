### **Capacity Reservation in AWS (clear concept)**

Normally in AWS, **EC2 capacity is not guaranteed** — if a region/AZ is full, you might not get the instance type you want.  
A **Capacity Reservation** means you tell AWS:

> “Keep X number of EC2 instances of type Y in AZ Z reserved for me — even if I’m not running them right now.”

---

### **Key points**

1. **Guarantees capacity**
    
    - Even if demand spikes (e.g., Black Friday, disaster recovery), you will always get your reserved instances.
        
    - AWS basically keeps those “slots” blocked for your account.
        
2. **You pay as soon as you reserve**
    
    - Doesn’t matter if you’re actually running an instance or not — you’re charged once the reservation is active.
        
    - Pricing is the same as On-Demand (unless combined with Savings Plans or RI for discounts).
        
3. **Scoped to a specific AZ, instance type, and count**
    
    - Example: Reserve 10 × m5.large in **ap-south-1a**.
        
    - Only that AZ, only that type, only that quantity.
        
4. **Flexible start/stop**
    
    - You can launch and stop instances inside the reserved pool whenever you like.
        
    - AWS ensures you’ll always get them, but you control usage.

### **Why it’s useful**

- **Critical workloads** → hospitals, banks, e-commerce during sales.
    
- **Disaster Recovery** → you _know_ you’ll get capacity during outages.
    
- **Regulated industries** → can’t risk “no capacity available” error.

### **Difference from Reserved Instances (RI)**

- **RI** = discount on pricing, but **no capacity guarantee**.
    
- **Capacity Reservation** = capacity guarantee, but pricing is On-Demand (unless combined with RI or Savings Plan).

👉 **One-line definition for memory:**  
**Capacity Reservation = paying AWS to “lock” specific EC2 capacity for you in advance, so it’s always available when you need it.**
