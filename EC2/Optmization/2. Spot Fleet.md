A **Spot Fleet** in AWS is a way to **launch and manage a collection of EC2 Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand Instances) automatically** to meet a certain capacity target at the lowest possible cost.

**1. What “Spot” means**

- **Spot Instances** are EC2 instances AWS sells at a huge discount (up to 90% off) because they’re [^1]*unused capacity*.
    
- Downside: AWS can reclaim them with short notice (2 minutes) if the capacity is needed elsewhere.
    

**2. What a “Fleet” means**

- Instead of requesting a single Spot Instance, a **Spot Fleet** lets you request **multiple instances, across multiple instance types and Availability Zones**, in one go.
    
- AWS automatically picks the **cheapest combination** that still meets your requirements.

**3. How it works**

- You define:
    
    - **Target capacity** (in vCPUs or instance count).
        
    - **List of instance types** you’re okay with.
        
    - **Max price** you’re willing to pay (or let AWS handle it).
        
    - **Launch template** or **launch specifications** with your settings.
        
- AWS continuously manages the fleet to maintain your target capacity, replacing instances if they’re interrupted or if cheaper capacity becomes available.

**4. Why use it**

- **Cost savings** — perfect for workloads that can handle interruptions (batch jobs, data analysis, rendering, CI/CD runners).
    
- **Flexibility** — AWS can choose from many instance pools to find cheaper/available capacity.
    

**5. Real-world example**

- A video rendering company needs 500 vCPUs for 3 hours.
    
- They create a Spot Fleet request with 5 instance types across 3 Availability Zones.
    
- AWS automatically picks the cheapest mix at the time and replaces any lost capacity during the job.

> [^1]: "Unused capacity" in AWS just means **EC2 servers in AWS data centers that are sitting idle** — no customer is currently running anything on them. In other words — Spot Instances exist because AWS wants to **make money off spare hardware** that’s not being used at that moment.


> [!NOTE]
> I get what you’re thinking, but the “unused capacity” in AWS **does not** mean “servers that another customer launched but is idle/not being used.”

> It actually means **physical EC2 host machines in AWS’s own data centers that nobody has rented yet**.  
> You can’t touch another customer’s EC2 — idle or not — because AWS completely isolates customers.

It helps in those fields mainly because **Spot Instances (and Spot Fleet) give you a massive amount of compute power for very cheap**, and those workloads **don’t care** if the servers get interrupted sometimes.


### **1. Data Processing (ETL, big data jobs, analytics)**

- You might need hundreds or thousands of vCPUs to crunch logs, process sensor data, or run Spark/Hadoop jobs.
    
- Spot Fleet can give you that compute power for **70–90% less cost** than On-Demand.
    
- [^2]If some instances are reclaimed, the job can simply resume or reprocess in chunks.
    

**Example:**  
A company processes 10 TB of clickstream logs every night. Using Spot Fleet, they finish in hours instead of days without breaking the budget.

---

### **2. Rendering (3D animation, video processing)**

- Rendering is CPU/GPU intensive and often takes days for big projects.
    
- You can throw a huge number of Spot instances at it and finish much faster.
    
- Losing a few instances mid-way is okay because rendering software can reassign frames to other machines.
    

**Example:**  
A VFX studio uses Spot Fleet to render scenes overnight at 1/10th the normal AWS cost.

---

### **3. AI/ML Training**

- Model training often needs powerful GPU instances (very expensive On-Demand).
    
- Spot Fleet can request the cheapest available GPU instances across multiple instance types and AZs.
    
- If an instance is taken back, the training job just continues from the last checkpoint.
    

**Example:**  
Training a computer vision model with 8 GPU instances via Spot Fleet instead of paying full price.

---

### **4. CI/CD Pipelines**

- Continuous integration systems often spin up short-lived servers to run builds/tests.
    
- Spot Fleet can cheaply supply large bursts of instances for parallel builds, then terminate them when done.
    

**Example:**  
A dev team runs 50 builds at once during a release — Spot Fleet handles it for a fraction of the cost.

---

### **5. Batch Workloads**

- “Batch” means jobs that can be split into many independent tasks (map-reduce style).
    
- Spot Fleet lets you process them faster by scaling to hundreds of nodes cheaply.
    
- Interruptions don’t hurt much because each task can be retried elsewhere.
    

**Example:**  
A genomic research lab analyzes millions of DNA sequences in parallel with Spot Fleet.

---

The key pattern:  
Spot Fleet shines when **you need huge compute temporarily**, and **you can handle interruptions without breaking the workflow**.

---

If you want, I can give you a **quick decision chart** so you instantly know if Spot Fleet is a good fit for a workload or not. That would save you from overthinking.

[^2]: By **“if an instance is taken back”**, I mean:
	
	When you use a **Spot Instance** (through Spot Fleet or alone), AWS is basically saying:
	
	> “You can use this spare server _for now_, but if another customer comes along willing to pay full On-Demand price for it, we’ll need it back.”
	
	So if AWS needs that capacity:
	
	1. They send you a **2-minute interruption notice**.
	    
	2. After those 2 minutes, the instance is **terminated** (or stopped/hibernated if you set it up that way).
	    
	3. Any work running on that instance stops — unless your application is designed to handle it and continue elsewhere.
	    
	
	---
	
	**Example:**  
	You’re training a machine learning model on 10 Spot Instances.
	
	- AWS suddenly needs 2 of those instances for another customer.
	    
	- You get a 2-minute warning.
	    
	- Your training script should save progress (“checkpoint”) and resume later on another instance.
	    
	
	That’s why Spot Fleet is useful — it can automatically launch replacement instances from other pools so you still meet your capacity target.
	
	---
	
	If you want, I can show you **exactly what happens inside AWS when they reclaim a Spot Instance**, step-by-step, so you understand the chain of events. That makes the “taken back” concept very clear.
