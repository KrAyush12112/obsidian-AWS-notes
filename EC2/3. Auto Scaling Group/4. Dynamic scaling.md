Dynamic scaling in AWS Auto Scaling allows your EC2 instances to respond automatically to changes in demand. There are **three types** of dynamic scaling policies, each with its own behavior and use case:

### 🎯 1. Target Tracking Scaling

**Concept**: Like a thermostat—it maintains a target value for a specific metric.

**How it works**:

- You define a target value for a CloudWatch metric (e.g., average CPU utilization at 60%).
    
- Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances to keep the metric close to the target.

**Pros**:

- Easy to set up.
    
- Automatically handles scaling in and out.
    
- No need to manually define alarms or thresholds.
    

**Use case**: Ideal for applications with consistent performance goals, like keeping latency low or CPU usage balanced.

### ⚖️ 2. Step Scaling

**Concept**: Responds with different scaling actions based on how far a metric breaches a threshold.

**How it works**:

- You define multiple thresholds and corresponding scaling actions.
    
- For example:
    
    - CPU > 70% → add 1 instance
        
    - CPU > 85% → add 2 instances
        

**Pros**:

- Offers fine-grained control.
    
- Suitable for workloads with varying intensity.
    

**Use case**: Great for applications with unpredictable spikes or gradual increases in traffic.

### 🔁 3. Simple Scaling

**Concept**: Triggers a fixed scaling action when a metric crosses a threshold.

**How it works**:

- A CloudWatch alarm monitors a metric (e.g., CPU > 80%).
    
- When triggered, it adds or removes a fixed number of instances.
    
- Includes a cooldown period to prevent rapid scaling.
    

**Pros**:

- Straightforward setup.
    
- Good for basic scaling needs.
    

**Use case**: Legacy option; best for small-scale apps or testing environments.
