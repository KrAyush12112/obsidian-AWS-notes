**AWS Launch Template** — it’s basically a reusable blueprint for launching EC2 instances.  
Think of it like a **“saved configuration”** that you can use over and over instead of filling out the EC2 launch wizard every time.

**Key points about Launch Templates:**

1. **Purpose** – To predefine instance settings so you can launch new EC2s quickly and consistently.  
    Example: Instead of remembering every setting (AMI, instance type, security groups, key pair, tags, etc.) you store them once in a template.
    
2. **What it can include:**
    
    - **AMI ID** (the OS image)
    - **Instance type** (t2.micro, m5.large, etc.)
    - **Security group(s)**
    - **Key pair**
    - **EBS volumes** config
    - **IAM role**
    - **User data script** (startup automation)
    - **Networking details** (VPC, subnet)
    - **Tags**
3. **Versioning** – Each change you make creates a **new version** of the template.  
    Example: v1 could be Ubuntu, v2 might switch to Amazon Linux, and you can choose which version to use later.
    
4. **Difference from Launch Configurations**
    
    - Launch Configurations are older and **cannot** be updated — you must create a new one.
        
    - Launch Templates are **newer, more flexible**, and support extra features like T2/T3 unlimited, placement groups, and spot instances.
        
5. **Common uses:**
    
    - **Auto Scaling Groups** (ASGs) → to automatically launch EC2s with predefined settings.
        
    - **Spot Fleets** → to request multiple spot instances with same config.
        
    - **Manual quick launches** → save time when spinning up test or prod servers.
        
6. **Why it’s useful in real life:**
    
    - Standardizes configuration (reduces mistakes).
        
    - Speeds up deployment.
        
    - Makes scaling automation possible.
        
    - Easier to maintain multiple versions for dev/test/prod.
