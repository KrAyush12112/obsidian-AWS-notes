AWS Auto Scaling offers three main strategies to manage your EC2 instances: **Manual**, **Scheduled**, and **Dynamic Scaling**. Each serves a different purpose depending on your application's needs.
### 🛠️ 1. Manual Scaling

**What it is**: You manually adjust the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group.

**Use case**: Useful for testing or when you want full control over scaling.

**How to set up**:

- Go to the **EC2 Auto Scaling Groups** section in the AWS Console.
- Select your Auto Scaling group.
- Click **Edit** and change the **Desired Capacity**, **Min**, or **Max** values.
- Save changes—AWS will launch or terminate instances to match the new desired capacity.

### ⏰ 2. Scheduled Scaling

**What it is**: You define scaling actions to occur at specific times (e.g., scale up every Monday at 9 AM).
**Use case**: Ideal for predictable workloads like business hours or seasonal traffic.
**How to set up**:
- In the EC2 Auto Scaling console, go to your Auto Scaling group.
- Under **Scheduled Actions**, click **Create Scheduled Action**.
- Set:
    - **Start time** (must be in the future)
    - **Recurrence** (optional, for repeated actions)
    - **Desired capacity**, **Min**, and **Max**
- Save the action. AWS will scale your group at the specified time.

### ⚙️ 3. [Dynamic Scaling](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=EC2%2F3.%20Auto%20Scaling%20Group%2F4.%20Dynamic%20scaling)
**What it is**: Automatically adjusts capacity based on real-time metrics like CPU usage or request count.

**Use case**: Best for applications with unpredictable or fluctuating traffic.

**How to set up**:

- Go to your Auto Scaling group in the AWS Console.
    
- Under **Automatic Scaling**, choose **Add Policy**.
    
- Select a policy type:
    
    - **Target Tracking**: Keeps a metric (e.g., CPU usage) at a target value.
        
    - **Step Scaling**: Scales based on how much a metric breaches a threshold.
        
    - **Simple Scaling**: Adds/removes a fixed number of instances when a CloudWatch alarm triggers.
        
- Define the metric, thresholds, and scaling adjustments.
    
- Save the policy—AWS will monitor and act based on your configuration.
    

Each method has its strengths. Manual gives control, scheduled gives predictability, and dynamic gives responsiveness. Want help choosing the best one for your use case or setting up a sample policy? I’d be glad to walk you through it.
