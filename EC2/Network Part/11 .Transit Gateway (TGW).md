# 🚍 What is **Transit Gateway (TGW)**?

### ✅ **Definition:**

A **Transit Gateway** is a **central router** that connects multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and VPNs — **scalable**, **hub-and-spoke** style.

> Think of it as a **modern airport hub** where all flights (VPCs, VPNs, etc.) connect through a central terminal instead of flying directly to each other.

## 🧠 Why Use TGW?

Because **VPC Peering doesn’t scale** well.  
If you connect 10 VPCs with peering:

- 🔺You need **45 separate connections** (N×(N−1)/2)
    
- Messy route tables, manual effort

With TGW:

- 🔻Just **plug each VPC into the hub**
    
- **1-to-many routing** via Transit Gateway
    
- **Centralized management**
