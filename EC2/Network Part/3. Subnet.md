## 🔍 Core Concepts Inside Subnet (Every Keyword Explained Clearly):

### 1. **CIDR Block**

- The IP range of the subnet.
    
- Example: `10.0.1.0/24` = 256 IPs, but only **251 usable**
    
- The range must be **within your VPC’s CIDR**.

👉 _Think of this as the size of the room (subnet) you're building inside the house (VPC)._

|CIDR|# of IPs|Common Use|
|---|---|---|
|`/16`|65,536 IPs|Large VPC|
|`/20`|4,096 IPs|Medium subnet|
|`/24`|256 IPs|Small subnet (common)|
|`/32`|1 IP|Used to specify a **single IP** (e.g., in SG rules)|
📦 What Does "IPv4 CIDR Block" Do in VPC?

When you create a **VPC**, AWS asks for an **IPv4 CIDR block**.
This:
- Defines the **total private IP range** available in your VPC
- Subnets inside your VPC will split this range further
**Example:**  
If your VPC is `10.0.0.0/16`, you can create subnets like:

- `10.0.1.0/24`
    
- `10.0.2.0/24`
    
- `10.0.3.0/28`
    

Each of these is a **sub-CIDR** inside the VPC's main CIDR.


###### Alternate Of CIDR

🔍 What Is **IPAM Allocated**?

> **IPAM = IP Address Manager**, an AWS service used to **centrally manage IPs** across multiple VPCs/accounts.

When you see **“IPAM allocated”** in the VPC creation screen, it means:

> “Do you want to use IP ranges **automatically assigned from your central IPAM pool**, or define them manually?”

You have 2 options:

1. ✅ **Manual IPv4 CIDR** (you type it yourself like `10.0.0.0/16`)
    
2. 🧠 **IPAM allocated CIDR** (AWS assigns CIDR from a managed pool)

### 2. **Public vs Private Subnet**

- **Public Subnet** = Has a route to the **Internet Gateway**
    
- **Private Subnet** = No direct route to Internet Gateway
    

➡️ EC2s in public subnet **can be accessed from internet** (if SG allows)  
➡️ EC2s in private subnet **cannot be accessed directly from internet**

---

### 3. **Route Table Association**

- Every subnet is connected to a **route table**
    
- That route table decides:
    
    - Where the traffic goes (IGW, NAT, other subnets, VPN)
        

🧠 _It’s like the subnet’s personal routing rulebook._

---

### 4. **Availability Zone (AZ)**

- Every subnet must live in **one specific AZ** (e.g., `ap-south-1a`)
    
- You can't span one subnet across zones.
    

➡️ For high availability, you create **multiple subnets in different AZs**

---

### 5. **Auto-Assign Public IP**

- A setting that decides:  
    👉 "Should EC2s launched here get public IPs automatically?"


🛑 Public subnet = usually **enabled**  
🛑 Private subnet = usually **disabled**

---

### 6. **Network ACL (NACL)**

- Acts like a **firewall at subnet level**
    
- Optional, but powerful
    
- Controls **inbound/outbound rules** for the whole subnet
    
- Unlike Security Groups, NACLs are **stateless** (you must allow both directions manually)
    

---

### 7. **IPv6 CIDR (Optional)**

- You can assign an **IPv6 range** to a subnet (if enabled in VPC)
    
- Required if you want to use **IPv6-based communication**
