## 🧠 What Is Egress-Only Internet Gateway?

An **Egress-Only Internet Gateway (EOIGW)** is a **one-way exit door for IPv6 traffic** from **private subnets** to **the internet**,  
but it **blocks incoming connections** — so it’s **outbound-only**.

👉 Think of it as a **NAT Gateway for IPv6**.

An egress-only internet gateway is stateful
## ❓Why Does It Exist?

Because:

- **IPv6 is always public.**  
    There’s **no such thing as private IPs** in IPv6 like `10.x.x.x` or `192.168.x.x`.
    

So if you give your EC2 an IPv6 address, it’s **directly reachable from the internet** —  
...unless you **route it through EOIGW**, which gives **outbound access only** and protects from inbound traffic.

## 📦 Use Case Example

- You have **IPv6-enabled EC2** in a private subnet
    
- You want it to **download OS patches / software** from the internet
    
- But you **don’t want anyone on the internet to connect back** to it
    

✅ Use EOIGW  
❌ Don’t use IGW (or EC2 will be publicly reachable)
