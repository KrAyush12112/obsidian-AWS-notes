## 🧠 What is an Internet Gateway?

An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is a **door between your VPC and the internet.**

But remember — it's just the door. Your EC2s **still need routing, IPs, and permissions** to walk through it.

---

## 🔍 Core Concepts You MUST Understand:

### 1. **Purpose**

- It lets resources **inside your VPC** (like EC2) connect to **the public internet**
    
- Also allows **incoming internet traffic** (like SSH, HTTP) **to reach EC2s**
    
- It supports both **IPv4 and IPv6**
    

🧠 _Without it, your VPC is **isolated from the internet**_
### 2. **Is It Automatically Created?**

❌ **No.** You must **manually create** and **attach** it to your VPC.

---
### 3. **What It Connects?**

It connects:

- **Your VPC**
    
- To the **Internet**
    

But you still need to:

- ✅ Attach it to the VPC
    
- ✅ Update your route table
    
- ✅ Make sure your subnet is public
    
- ✅ Ensure security group allows traffic
## 🛠 What Makes It Work?

You need all 5 below or **your EC2 won’t be publicly reachable**:

| ✅ Step           | 🧾 Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Create IGW    | Go to VPC → IGW → Create                                                                               |
| 2. Attach to VPC | Select your VPC → Attach                                                                               |
| 3. Route Table   | Add route: `0.0.0.0/0 → igw-xxxx` (for IPv4)                                                           |
| 4. Subnet        | Subnet must be associated with that Route Table                                                        |
| 5. EC2 Settings  | - Auto-assign public IP **enabled**  <br>- Security Group allows inbound  <br>- Key pair added for SSH |
## ⚙️ Internally, What Happens?

Let’s say you SSH into EC2:

1. EC2 has a **public IP**
    
2. EC2 sends packet → Route Table forwards it to IGW
    
3. IGW passes it to the internet
    
4. Response from internet comes back → IGW forwards to EC2

🔁 It works **both ways** (outbound + inbound) if configured correctly.

## ✅ Inbound vs Outbound (Simple and Sharp)

|Direction|What It Means|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Inbound**|Data **coming INTO** your EC2 from outside|Someone SSHs into your EC2|
|**Outbound**|Data **going OUT** from your EC2 to others|EC2 sends request to a website (e.g., apt install, curl)|

> 🔁 EC2 is a machine. It talks, listens, and responds — **just like your personal computer**.

## 🛡️ Why It Matters for Security Groups (SG)?

Security Groups control:

- **Inbound rules** = Who can talk **to** the EC2
    
- **Outbound rules** = Who EC2 can talk **to**
    

If:

- You block **inbound port 22**, you can’t SSH
    
- You block **outbound 443**, EC2 can’t access HTTPS APIs
    

	So networking is **just managing who can talk to whom, and through which port**.

## 🧱 Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway

| Feature                   | Internet Gateway                          | NAT Gateway                                         |     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Purpose                   | Public internet access for public subnets | Internet access for private subnets (outbound only) |     |
| Needs Public IP?          | ✅ Yes                                     | ❌ No                                                |     |
| Incoming Traffic Allowed? | ✅ Yes (if SG allows)                      | ❌ No                                                |     |
| Cost                      | Free                                      | 💸 Paid (₹₹₹)                                       |     |
| For EC2 In?               | Public Subnet                             | Private Subnet                                      |     |
