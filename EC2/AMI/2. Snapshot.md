# 🔹 What is a Snapshot in AWS?

A **Snapshot is just a backup of your EBS volume (disk).**
- It’s **point-in-time copy** of your EC2 disk data.
- Stored in **S3 internally by AWS** (but you don’t see it in S3 bucket).
- Can be used to **restore/duplicate your volume** later.

---

# 🔹 Analogy (Super Clear)
- **Snapshot** = A photo of your **hard disk only** (nothing else).
- **AMI** = A full **blueprint of a server** (OS + software + configs + permissions)
So → Snapshot = raw storage backup,  
while AMI = complete package to launch EC2 instances.

# 🔹 Key Properties of Snapshots

1. **Incremental** → After first snapshot, only changed blocks are saved in next ones → saves storage cost.
    
2. **Region-bound** → Stored in one region, but you can copy to another region.
    
3. **Used for Backup/Restore** → If EC2 crashes, create a new EBS from snapshot → attach → data is back.

# 🔹 Relation Between Snapshot and AMI

👉 An **AMI internally uses a snapshot** for its root volume.  
When you create an AMI → AWS takes a **snapshot of the root volume** + adds launch settings (permissions, block mapping, etc.).

- Snapshot alone ≠ enough to launch an EC2.
    
- AMI = Snapshot + metadata + launch permissions.

# 🔹 Example (Practical)

1. You have a database EC2 with 200 GB EBS.
    
2. You take a **snapshot** → backup stored in AWS.
    
3. Tomorrow your DB gets corrupted → you create a **new EBS volume from that snapshot** → attach to EC2 → restore data.
    
4. But if you want **to launch a new identical server** with OS + DB installed → you need an **AMI**, not just snapshot.

# 🔹 When to Use

- **Snapshot** →
    
    - Backup EBS volumes.
        
    - Migrate data across regions.
        
    - Increase EBS size (create new volume from snapshot with bigger size).
        
- **AMI** →
    
    - Launch new EC2 servers.
        
    - Auto Scaling.
        
    - Disaster recovery (full server clone).

✅ **One Line Final Takeaway:**  
**Snapshot = backup of a disk (EBS volume).**  
**AMI = server blueprint that uses snapshots + extra configs to launch EC2.**
